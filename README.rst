============
Emacs config
============

Description
===========

These file are intended to be ran automatically when starting emacs.
This is my (Antoine Pelisse) emacs configuration.

Install
=======

Rename and move the ``dot.emacs.el`` file into ``~/.emacs.el``.
It will allow emacs to automatically load the configuration.

It does nothing but load all files from git repository (which should
be named ``~/.emacs.d``.
